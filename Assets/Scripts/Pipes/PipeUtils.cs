/**
 * @brief Direction handles the direction of the pipe in the pipe game.
 * @details This game works by making sure that whatever is flowing through
 * the pipes can only flow in one direction.
 *
 * For straight pipes, this is rather straight forward, if the pipe is up,
 * then it's in a shape like | and it flows upwards.
 *
 * Turn pipes are a little different. A diagram is drawn below. The | and --
 * indicate the pipe itself, while arrows such as ->, <-,
 * ^      |
 * |, and v, indicate flow.
 *
 * turnPipe up
 *          |--   ->
 *          |
 *
 *          ^
 *          |
 *
 * turnpike right
 *
 *  ->   --|
 *         |
 *
 *         |
 *         v
 *
 * turnpipe down
 *
 *           |
 *           v
 *
 *           |
 *   <-    --|
 *
 * turnpipe left
 *
 *        ^
 *        |
 *
 *        |
 *        |--  <-
 *
 *
 * Notice that the flow starts in the direction of the Direction, and ends 90 deg clockwise
 *
 * For source and sink nodes, it is also a little different
 * For source nodes, the direction will be where the water must flow and it will come out of the bottom of the triangle
 * For sink nodes, the direction will be where the water must flow into and it will flow into the bottom of the triangle
 *
 * Down direction for sink node
 *
 *         |
 *         v
 *
 *       ----
 *       \  /
 *        \/
 *
 * Down direction for source node
 *
 *        /\
 *       /  \
 *       ----
