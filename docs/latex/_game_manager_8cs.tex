\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em The Game Manager script is responsible for managing the game state. This allows for states to persist between scenes. This is a singleton class. The main part of this class is the {\ttfamily player\+Spawn\+Position} member, which holds the players position. This is mainly used in transitions between scenes so that we can spawn the player back where they were before they entered the scene. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
